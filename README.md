# Chat Bridging Relay

Relays messages between different chat services.

Currently only supports connecting as an IRC client and service, which means Slack is supported
via its IRC gateway. Native support for Slack is planned, as well as native Matrix support. The
model is flexible enough to support any service with a concept of users, channels/rooms, and
messages.

Contributions welcome.
